// This defines a custom React hook called useFetch. The hook takes a single argument, 
// url, which is the endpoint of the API to fetch. It uses the useState hook to define 
// three state variables: data, loading, and error. The data state variable is used to store the response data from the API. 
// It is initialized as null because we don't have any data yet. The loading state variable is 
// used to indicate whether or not the API request is currently being made. It is initialized as false because 
// we are not making any requests yet. The error state
// variable is used to indicate whether or not the API request failed. It is initialized 
// as false because we haven't made any requests yet.

  // This uses the useEffect hook to make the API request. 
  // It calls an async function called fetchData that sets 
  // the loading state to true to indicate that the request is being made. 
  // It then uses the makeRequest module's get method to make the API request with the provided url. 
  // If the request is successful, the setData function is called to update the data state with the response data. 
  // If the request fails, the setError function is called to set the error state to true. 
  // Finally, the loading state is set back to false to indicate that the request has finished. The useEffect hook 
  // takes a dependency array containing the url argument, which ensures that the hook will only re-run if the url changes.
